### Hi there üòÅ

I'm Leo, from S√£o Paulo - BR. I'm gratuated in Technology (FATEC-OU) and I have two MBAs, the first in Oracle Database Administrations and the second in Project Management (FGV). I'm also OCA, PSM and CSPO certified. I've been working as developer and business analyst since 1999. Currently I'm working as a software development engineer at [Fiserv](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fiserv/) and I'm studying Java applications using Spring Boot Framework. Besides that, I'm studying Geography. I'm father of two girls (Clara and Manu, Daddy loves you). In my free time, I usually walk and listen music and podcasts and I like to read Geography and History books as well. I'm a Volunteacher at [CPM](https://www.cidadaopromundo.org/) a NGO that helps students from communities to learn english.
