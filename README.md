### Hi there üòÅ

I'm Leo, from S√£o Paulo - BR. I'm gratuated in Technology (FATEC-OU) and MBA in Oracle Database Administrations and Project Management (FGV). I'm also OCA, PSM and CSPO certified. I've been working as developer and business analyst since 1999. Currently I'm working as a software developer and Tech Lead at [CVC Corp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cvc/) and I'm studying ReactJS and Java Spring applications (APIs). Besides that, I'm studying a degree in Geography. I'm father of two girls (Clara and Manu, Daddy loves you). In my free time, I usually listen to music, walk the dog and stay with my family, we all love to travel. I'm also a Volunteacher at [CPM](https://www.cidadaopromundo.org/) a NGO that helps students from communities to learn english.
