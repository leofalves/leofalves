### Hi there üòÅ

I'm Leo, from S√£o Paulo - BR.

Currently, I'm working as an Oracle developer at [Luxair](https://www.linkedin.com/company/luxair/mycompany/) and studying Java applications using Spring Boot Framework (Web, MVC, JPA, Junit).

I'm Elaine's husband and father of two beautiful girls (Clara and Manu, Daddy loves you). In my free time, I usually walk (4~5K every day) listening to music. I like to read Geography and History stuff and listen to podcasts about it. 

I hold a degree in Technology (FATEC-OU) and I have two MBAs as well. The first in Oracle Database Administrations and the second in Project Management (FGV). I've been working as a developer, business analyst and tech lead since 1999. I am also a Volunteacher at [CPM](https://www.cidadaopromundo.org/), an NGO that helps young students to learn English.
