### Hi there üòÅ

I'm Leo, from S√£o Paulo - BR. I am the father of two beautiful girls, Clara and Manuela.

Currently, I work as an Oracle Consultant at [CVC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cvc/).

I hold a degree in Technology (FATEC-OU) and I¬¥ve finished two specializations, the first one Oracle Database Administration (FIAP) and the second one Project Management (FGV). 

I've been working in the IT area since 1999, playing different roles as a developer, business analyst, and tech lead. I¬¥ve worked for different companies, such as banks, tourism operators, and airline companies. 

I've also had two international work experiences, the first in Angola and the second in Luxembourg and I have an experience as a volunteer at [CPM](https://www.cidadaopromundo.org/), an NGO that helps young students to learn English.
